\chapter{Lecture 1: Complex exponentials and periodic signals}

\section{Complex arithmetic and polar form}

Although in typical applications, we deal with real numbers (to some fixed precision), allowing ourselves to work also with complex number can add a great variety of additional tools to bring to bear. In particular, we will eventually see that periodic functions, such as the sine and cosine, can be efficiently and compactly described via complex exponential functions, and doing this makes it a great deal more efficient decompose periodic signals into basic waveforms (i.e. via the Fourier transform).

Recall that a complex number $z = x + iy$, can be thought of graphically as a point in the complex plane, where we think of $x$ and $y$ as the coordinates of a point $(x, y)$. In this representation, it is clear that addition of complex numbers corresponds to addition of vectors -- that is
\[ (x_1 + i y_1) + (x_2 + i y_2) = (x_1 + x_2) + i (y_1 + y_2)\]
agrees with the vector sum
\[ (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2) \]
But what about complex multiplication? For multiplication we see a nice visual interpretation by considering a polar representation of the complex number: if the point $(x_j, y_j)$, $j = 1, 2$ in the plane correpsonds to a vector of length $r_j$ and making an angle of $\theta_j$ with the positive $x$-axis, then we may write
\[z_j = x_j + i y_j = r_j \cos \theta_j + i r_j \sin \theta_j \]
and we find (using the sum formula for sine and cosine):

\begin{align} \label{angles add}
(x_1 + i y_1)(x_2 + i y_2) &= (r_1 \cos \theta_1 + i r_1 \sin \theta_1)(r_2 \cos \theta_2 + i r_2 \sin \theta_2) \\ &= r_1 r_2 \Big( (\cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 - \sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2) (\cos \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 + \cos \theta_2 \sin \theta_1 )\Big) \\ &= r_1 r_2 \cos (\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i r_1 r_2 \sin (\theta_1 + \theta_2).
\end{align}

Said another way, we can visualize the multiplication of complex numbers in the following way: \textbf{lengths multiply and angles add}.

\section{Complex Exponentials}

We can view complex multiplication in a more intuitive light with the aid of Euler's formula, which gives a relationship between the complex exponential function and the polar representation of a complex number. Euler's formula states that for a real number\footnote{in fact the formula holds for complex numbers as well, and can be taken as a definition of cosine and sine for complex arguments} $t$, we have
\[e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta. \]
This formula can be verified by, for example, replacing each side by the corresponding power series expansions.

The complex exponential function -- that is, the function $e^z$ where $z$ can be any complex number, shares the usual familar properties with its real counterpart: $e^{z + w} = e^z e^w$, immediately giving again the multiplication rule from equation~\ref{angles add} above.

Let's visualize how the graph of the function $e^{i \theta}$ as a function of the real variable $\theta$. 

\iffalse
Given a complex number, expressed as \[z = r \cos \theta + i r \sin \theta,\] we see that we can raise $z$ to positive integer powers by the formula
\[z^n = r^n \cos n\theta + i r^n \sin n\theta.\]
In particular, it makes sense to extend this definition and simply define the exponential $z^s$ for any real number $s$, by the formula
\[z^s = r^s \cos s\theta + i r^s \sin s\theta\]
